# home-manager-brew

This nix flake contains a home-manager module that allows you to install and
manage [homebrew](https://brew.io) packages (formulae, cask, taps, mas, ...)
with [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

The goal is to extends nix and home-manager configuration. Some applications
are not yet available for nix but those are already on brew, or if you have
custom/private taps and you would still be able to set them up with
home-manager.
